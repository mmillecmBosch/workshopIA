## Acceptance Criteria
> Add this section inside the Field Name:Acceptance Criteria inside the Feature in Azure devops
### Backend

- [ ] [API or service behavior that must be implemented â€” be specific about inputs, outputs, and field names.]
- [ ] [Data filtering or transformation rule that must be applied server-side.]
- [ ] [Edge case or error condition the backend must handle and how it should respond.]

> Example entries:
> - The API response must include a `role` field for each item, indicating its position relative to the primary record (e.g., `primary`, `predecessor`, `successor`).
> - Results must be filtered server-side based on a specific attribute (e.g., `type`, `status`, `category`). Only records matching the approved values should be returned.
> - **Note:** The final list of allowed/excluded values for [attribute] is pending review by [stakeholder].

### Frontend

- [ ] **[Component or view name]:** Description of what must be displayed and any conditional logic (e.g., show/hide fields, visual state).
- [ ] **[Component or view name]:** Description of what must be displayed and any conditional logic.
- [ ] **Edge case â€” [scenario name]:** How the UI must respond when a specific condition is met (e.g., empty state, warning, error).

> Example entries:
> - **Primary item:** Display all available data fields â€” image, identifier, description, quantity, price, status, and any supplemental links.
> - **Historical/replaced items:** Display identifier, description, and status only. Do not display quantity, location breakdown, or pricing â€” this data has no actionable value for obsolete records.
> - **Current/latest item:** Display all available data fields and apply a visual highlight (e.g., "Latest" badge) to distinguish it from intermediate items.
> - **Warning state:** If the API response includes `warning.flag = true`, display a visible inline warning near the affected component. The warning must not block the user from viewing the rest of the content.
